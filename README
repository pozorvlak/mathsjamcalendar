The Glasgow MathsJam meets on the second-to-last Tuesday of the month.

I, like many other people in these degenerate days, keep my appointments and
other events in a trusted external system, which in my case is Google Calendar.

The iCal spec provides for events recurring on, for instance, the
second-to-last Tuesday of the month.

Google Calendar does not implement this part of the spec.

Hence, this program.


REQUIREMENTS

You will need to install the following CPAN modules:

* Data::ICal
* Data::ICal::DateTime
* DateTime::Event::Recurrence

On most Unix systems, this is as simple as typing

    cpan Data::ICal Data::ICal::DateTime DateTime::Event::Recurrence

at a command-prompt and possibly answering some easy questions.

You'll also need the Perl interpreter installed; this comes installed by
default on all non-stupid operating systems.


USAGE

Edit the file create.pl so that the $start and $end variables cover the range
of dates you care about. [Yes, this is ugly. Patches plz?]

Run the program, and capture the output:

    ./create.pl > mathsjam.ics

Import mathsjam.ics into your calendaring program, or stick it up on the Web,
or whatever you want to do with it.
